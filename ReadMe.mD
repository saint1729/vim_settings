### About
This git repository has a collection of settings that I use for my vim editor.
You can find special macros enabed for latex and gams currently. 

### Tex file documentation
* `<F9>`:			Saves the file. Saves the current view. Compiles the file using pdflatex. Any log is not printed on the terminal, rather goes into GARBAGE.txt.
* `:call Dtemp()`:	Deletes all temporary files belonging to current file, created as a result of pdflatex compilation.
* `:call Dtempall()`:	Deletes all temporary files belonging to all .tex files in the current directory.
* `:call Tex()`:		Gives a starting template for LaTeX documents. The initial template contents can be edited in plugins/TexTempl.tex.
